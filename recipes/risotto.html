    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Risotto is an Italian main or side dish that uses short-grain rice. This type of rice, which is quite round and
        looks very different from long-grain rice, releases lots of starch during cooking so the finished dish is very
        creamy and rich.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>5 cups warm chicken broth </li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, diced</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 cups Arborio rice</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dry white wine, or chicken broth</li>
        <li>1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place chicken broth in a heavy saucepan and bring to a gentle simmer over low heat.</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in another heavy saucepan over medium heat. Cook the onion and garlic, stirring frequently, until the onion becomes translucent, about 4 to 5 minutesâ€”don't let the vegetables brown.</li>
        <li>Stir in the rice and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, for 3 to 4 minutes, until some grains begin to look translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the wine or extra 1/2 cup chicken broth. Cook and stir until liquid is absorbed.</li>
        <li>Add about 1/2 cup of simmering chicken broth to the rice mixture, stirring constantly and cooking until the liquid is absorbed.</li>
        <li>Add more broth, about 1 cup at a time, cooking and stirring until it's absorbed and repeating until the rice is done. The whole cooking process should take about 20 to 25 minutes. The rice should be tender but firm in the center (or al dente). Test it by biting into some grains.</li>
        <li>When the rice is done, remove the pan from the heat and stir in the cheese and butter, and salt and pepper to taste. Stir until melted, then serve.</li>
    </ol>
