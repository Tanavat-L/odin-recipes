    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 350g of spaghetti</li>
        <li> 200g of guanciale</li>
        <li> 4 whole medium eggs</li>
        <li> 100 g of grated Pecorino Romano</li>
        <li> grounded black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the water for the pasta while you prepare the carbonara sauce. Cut the guanciale into small pieces then cook in a skillet over medium heat for about 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Now prepare the pecorino cream. So, in a bowl put the eggs and pecorino Romano cheese. Use the whole egg, not only the egg yolk.</li>
        <li>Add some freshly ground black pepper. Then, mix quickly with a fork - or a hand whisk - until you have a creamy sauce.</li>
        <li>The water should now be boiling so add the salt and cook the spaghetti</li>
        <li>Drain the pasta when ready. Then place them in the skillet, over high heat, to season well with the guanciale.</li>
        <li>When the spaghetti and guanciale sizzle in the pan, TURN OFF THE HEAT, otherwise the eggs will overcook and you'll end up with scrambled eggs and pasta!</li>
        <li>Now quickly add the eggs and pecorino cream to the hot pasta and stir. The pan is not too hot, this way the eggs will cook without lumps.</li>
        <li>With the help of a ladle and a fork, create a pasta nest and place it on a plate.</li>
        <li>Add the guanciale (what's left in the pan), freshly ground black pepper and grated pecorino romano to taste. Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
